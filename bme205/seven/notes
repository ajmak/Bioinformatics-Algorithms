if you have 3 symbols you can normalize to .7
if took implementation from prev assignment in case where sigma is greater than 0 - normalize to not sigma - calc this value --> get to a probability of 1 when summing all of those with minimum value of sigma

The names of your states must be regular enough to not have if statemtns
during construction of the viterbi - don't use special cases to develop those
       build start state outside of your main loop to avoid special cases
