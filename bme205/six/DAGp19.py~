"""
Finds the longest path in a directed acyclic graph from a given source node to sink node and its associated weight.

Input: The edges of a directed acyclic graph and their weights and the source and sink of the subpath desired
Output: The longest path from source to sink and the cumulative edge weight it took to get there

Parses source and sink nodes from input file when provided at the top of tbe file and separated by newlines
